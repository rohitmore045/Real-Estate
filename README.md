Users can search for properties based on various filters like location, price range, property type (apartments, houses, etc.), number of bedrooms/bathrooms, amenities (parking, gym, etc.)
Detailed property listings with high-quality photos, virtual tours (optional), and descriptions.
Integrated mapping functionality to view properties on a map and visualize their location relative to amenities and points of interest.
Secure booking system allowing users to schedule appointments for property viewings.
Property Management:

Property owners can create and manage their listings directly within the app.
Easy-to-use interface for updating property details, including photos, descriptions, and availability.
Ability to track booking requests and manage communication with potential tenants/buyers.
Real-Time Chat:

Built-in chat functionality enabling real-time communication between property seekers and owners.
Secure messaging platform for discussing property details, scheduling viewings, and asking questions.
Additional Features (Optional):

Affordability calculator to estimate monthly mortgage payments.
Neighborhood information with ratings and reviews from previous residents.
Integration with credit check services for streamlining the application process.
Push notifications for new listings, booking confirmations, and message alerts.
Technology Stack (Options):

Mobile Development: Choose a native development approach (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) or a cross-platform framework (React Native, Flutter) for wider reach.
Backend Development: Select a scalable and secure backend technology like Node.js, Python (Django/Flask) or Java (Spring Boot).
Database: Utilize a robust database solution like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to store property listings, user data, and booking information.
Mapping Service: Integrate with a mapping service like Google Maps or Mapbox to display property locations and neighborhood details.
Real-time Communication: Implement a real-time messaging solution like Firebase, Pusher, or Socket.IO to enable in-app chat functionality.
Project Deliverables:

A fully functional mobile application for iOS and/or Android.
A well-documented backend server handling data management and communication.
User interface designs for both the mobile app and the web interface (if applicable).
